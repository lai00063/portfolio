**Q:** Can you tell us about your web portfolio development process?

**A:** Absolutely. I used Bootstrap to build my web portfolio, which was a fantastic aid in establishing the core structure smoothly. Bootstrap's responsive capabilities facilitated an easy transition between desktop and mobile views. Since most of the layouts were constructed using HTML and responsive properties, adapting from mobile to web versions was relatively seamless.

**Q:** What were some challenges you faced during the development?

**A:** One notable challenge was perfecting the glitch animation for the hero banner. I aimed to imbue the website with a glitchy aesthetic, so I drew inspiration from a CSS animation I found online and tailored it to my design. Adjusting elements like color, animation duration, and positioning proved a bit intricate, but I eventually achieved the desired effect.

**A:** Things became a bit complex when I tackled the mobile version of the hero banner. I wanted the "portfolio" animation to be layered on top, so I utilized the hero banner as a background image. However, the transition to the mobile version caused everything to go awry. It took quite a bit of time and effort to make the necessary adjustments for a presentable appearance on mobile devices.

**A:** Another challenge centered around achieving consistent appearance and positioning. While I had meticulously designed everything in Adobe XD, translating that into actual implementation was akin to solving a puzzle. It demanded a lot of trial and error to ensure the sizing and placement aligned with the original design.

**A:** I also had my share of minor but impactful mistakes. For instance, while crafting the "Taiwan Bird: The Voice of Nature" read more page, I inadvertently inserted a spacebar before the naming. It drove me almost to the brink before I finally pinpointed the error.

**A:** Furthermore, since this was my first experience using Bootstrap for a project, I had a learning curve to navigate. At times, when I sought to adjust element positions, my initial instinct was to delve into the CSS. It took me a while to realize that HTML often offered more efficient solutions.

**A:** I must admit, Google became my companion throughout. I needed answers to various queries, like how to create a skip link for the navigation hamburger. It turned out to be an immensely helpful resource.

**Q:** How did you overcome these challenges?

**A:** In addressing the challenge of the hero banner animation, I meticulously customized an existing CSS animation to align with my design goals. As for the mobile version, I invested significant time experimenting with layouts and tweaking CSS properties. I even revisited the design concept to ensure it translated well to smaller screens.

**A:** For the sizing, positioning, and other issues, I adopted patience and hyper-attention to detail. I learned the hard way that even minuscule errors can lead to substantial frustrations. This experience made thorough double-checking a habit for me.

**A:** My journey of embracing Bootstrap was an enlightening one. I found a wealth of answers online, including tutorials for specific tasks such as creating skip links for navigation hamburgers. Drawing from these resources helped me surmount challenges and gain greater comfort with the framework.

**Q:** What did you learn from creating your web portfolio?

**A:** The process of creating this web portfolio imparted several valuable lessons. First, I gained a deep appreciation for the potency of responsive design enabled by Bootstrap. This made adapting to various screen sizes a significantly smoother endeavor.

**A:** My newfound mantra became attention to detail. I realized that minor errors can snowball into major issues. This insight prompted me to be meticulous in my work and rigorously test everything.

**A:** Problem-solving emerged as a strength. I understood that challenges are not obstacles but avenues for growth. Whether through diligent research or the trial-and-error process, uncovering solutions became second nature.

**A:** I also recognized the crucial role of using the right tools for specific tasks. Discovering that HTML often held the key to many positioning adjustments proved to be a time-saving revelation.

**A:** Lastly, I developed a knack for resourcefulness. I leaned heavily on online tutorials, guides, and forums. Witnessing the supportive nature of the online community in terms of problem-solving and skill enhancement was truly remarkable.

**A:** So, in a nutshell, my journey in developing this web portfolio underscored my adaptability, tenacity, and the invaluable insights I accumulated along the way.
